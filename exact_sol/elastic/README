Because of the nature of the files I received and my need to 
read them in to mesh objects and GridFunction objects in 
MFEM, I utilized ChatGPT to generate some scripts to handle
the processing of the received data. The process to break 
down the space delimited file of values into separate files 
for the necessary columns is the following:

   (1) Parse the desired columns
         python3 col_parser.py all_results.txt 0 16
         cols:
            0  - x_gf
            13 - rho mixture
            14 - pressure mixture
            15 - total energy mixture
            16 - stress 00
            18 - vx
            19 - vy

   (2) Convert the cell center values to cell boundary values,
       as that is what the mesh file must contain. This shift 
       is hard coded to 0.005.
         python3 convert_center_to_edgy.py column_0.txt column_0_new.txt
   (3) Generate mfem mesh from endpoint data
         python3 generate_mfem_mesh.py column_0_new.txt sol.mesh

UPDATE (03/27/2025):
  This functionality is no longer needed since errors and convergence 
  rates are computed using a python script.
